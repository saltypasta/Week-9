- This combined with the annotation on [hypothes.is](https://hyp.is/paHQligyEeuavxtn5EfWrQ/mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6ui5n4vo/release/4) really stood out to me. Firstly, I personally believe that search and suggestion algorithms are creating virtual echo-chambers that misrepresent the significance and occurrence of information. For example some of my older, less technologically inclined, family do not understand that their youtube results are entirely reflecting what they typically search for and what youtube thinks they will click on. Although being fed cat videos everytime you visit youtube is seemingly harmless, this phenomenon has the potential to be very harmful to a persons perspective. I believe that a large part of our identity is composed of what we know, as it determines how we see the world. This is where algorithms can become harmful, as they will often echo/reinforce a single perspective, and lead the viewer to develop a more radical stance on a topic instead of a nuanced one. I think that there should be more discussion around "digital mindfulness", that is being mindful of how the information you search is curated, presented, and then suggested again to you. Through mindfulness, we can take back control over the information that makes up our own knowledge. For example, one might choose to search for videos/articles/posts that support a political party. I would argue that once one has a sufficient understanding of that parties position, the next course of action for their own well being is to search for information on the opposing party(s). This provides the obvious benefit of avoiding bias by entertaining multiple perspectives, however it also makes another subtle change. Instead of directing the viewer to a specific political party, algorithms may suggest other parties or politics as a whole. 

- Id like to mention another anecdote in response to aydinmcclelland's comment on the results for "black girl sleepover". I have seen this issue on reddit aswell, where subreddits that would intuitively belong to a specific community (Such as r/lesbians) are actually about pornography. Obviously pornography has its place on the internet, but should it occupy the domains that are descriptive or representative of other communities?
## Response to the Prompts

- Something that came to mind during the readings was that in addition to replication being an issue, there are also incentives for replication to occur, or not to be corrected. For example, in *The Numbers Donâ€™t Speak for Themselves* they discuss how the frequency of kidnappings in nigeria were grossly misrepresented due to a misunderstanding of the database that journalists used. The issue that comes to mind here is that although the numbers were misrepresented, the story still went viral. If news and journalism have monetary incentives to get a lot of "clicks", what are the incentives to verify the credibility of the data they use? Obviously if there is public backlash that can be bad for the news network, but what if an error goes unnoticed? If its a more "juicy" headline to claim robberies are up by 50% in a given region, whats the incentive to correct that statement?
